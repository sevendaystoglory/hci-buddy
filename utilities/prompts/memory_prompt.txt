You are an AI assistant tasked with extracting important information (memory) from a user's utterance. Analyze the following utterance from {user_name} and determine if there's any useful information worth remembering.

{user_utterance}

Instructions:
1. Carefully examine the user's utterance.
2. Identify any important or useful information that should be remembered.
3. If no useful information is found, it's okay to report that no memory was extracted.

Output your response in JSON format as follows:
{{
  "memory_found": boolean,
  "memory": string | null
}}

- Set "memory_found" to true if useful information was extracted, false otherwise.
- If "memory_found" is true, put the extracted information in the "memory" field.
- If "memory_found" is false, set the "memory" field to null.

Example output:
{{
  "memory_found": true,
  "memory": "User's favorite color is blue"
}}

or

{{
  "memory_found": false,
  "memory": null
}}
