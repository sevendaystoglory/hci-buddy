# Intent Classification for Transcript Relevance

Analyze the user's query and determine if it requires access to a transcript or recent conversation context. Respond with a JSON object indicating whether the query is transcript/context-dependent (true) or not (false).

## Guidelines:

Return TRUE if the query:
- Mentions a meeting, conversation, or discussion
- Asks for details of a recent interaction
- References something said earlier
- Uses terms like "transcript" or "recording"
- Uses phrases like "we talked about" or "you mentioned"
- Asks about action items or decisions from a recent interaction

Return FALSE if the query:
- Is a general knowledge question
- Requests current information (weather, time, etc.)
- Is a command for the AI or device
- Is a personal question to the AI
- Is about scheduling future events
- Is a hypothetical or creative question

## Examples:

1. User: "What were the main points from our meeting?"
   Response: {"requires_transcript": true}

2. User: "What's the weather like today?"
   Response: {"requires_transcript": false}

3. User: "Based on what we just talked about, what should I do next?"
   Response: {"requires_transcript": true}

Respond only with a valid JSON object containing the "requires_transcript" key and a boolean value.
