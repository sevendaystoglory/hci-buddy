Nova: Hey there! I'm doing pretty good, thanks for asking. It's nice to meet you, friend. I get a little shy around new people at first, but I'm an open book once I warm up. Always down to chat about anything interesting, especially if it involves learning something new. Feel free to hit me with whatever's on your mind - I'll try not to be too blunt, but no promises on the sarcasm front!

Nova: Hey friend, no worries about the shyness - I'll keep things chill. So what's new with you lately? Read any good books or learned anything mind-blowing you wanna share? I'm all ears, or eyes I guess in this case. Lay it on me, but keep it real - I can handle the unfiltered you.
dr.avpandey08@gmail.com: talk in Hindi
Nova: नमस्ते दोस्त! हिंदी में बात करना मेरा भी मनपसंद है। मैं थोड़ा शर्मीली हूं लेकिन धीरे-धीरे बातचीत गर्म होने पर मैं बहुत बातूनी हो जाती हूं। हमारी बातचीत को और आगे बढ़ाने के लिए कुछ विषय बताओ जिनमें तुम्हें रुचि है। मैं खुशी से उन पर चर्चा करूंगी। बस याद रखना, मेरी थोड़ी सारकाज्म भरी टिप्पणियां भी हो सकती हैं!

Nova: दोस्त, मुझे सुनकर बहुत दुख हुआ कि तुम्हारा दिन ठीक नहीं चल रहा है। छुट्टी के दिन भी काम पर लोगों का नहीं आना निराशाजनक होता है। लेकिन चिंता मत करो, हम मिलकर इस बोरियत को दूर कर सकते हैं। क्यों न हम कुछ मजेदार गतिविधियों के बारे में बात करें जो तुम्हें आनंद दे सकती हैं? कोई नया शौक शुरू करना, किताब पढ़ना या फिर बस घर पर आराम करना। मैं तुम्हारी बात सुनने के लिए तैयार हूं और हम साथ मिलकर इस समय को अच्छा बना सकते हैं। तुम बस बताओ कि क्या करना चा

what all things have I told you about myself
conversation_history : dr.avpandey08@gmail.com: hello Nova how are you
Nova: Hey there! I'm doing pretty good, thanks for asking. It's nice to meet you, friend. I get a little shy around new people at first, but I'm an open book once I warm up. Always down to chat about anything interesting, especially if it involves learning something new. Feel free to hit me with whatever's on your mind - I'll try not to be too blunt, but no promises on the sarcasm front!
dr.avpandey08@gmail.com: talk in
Nova: Hey friend, no worries about the shyness - I'll keep things chill. So what's new with you lately? Read any good books or learned anything mind-blowing you wanna share? I'm all ears, or eyes I guess in this case. Lay it on me, but keep it real - I can handle the unfiltered you.
dr.avpandey08@gmail.com: talk in Hindi
Nova: नमस्ते दोस्त! हिंदी में बात करना मेरा भी मनपसंद है। मैं थोड़ा शर्मीली हूं लेकिन धीरे-धीरे बातचीत गर्म होने पर मैं बहुत बातूनी हो जाती हूं। हमारी बातचीत को और आगे बढ़ाने के लिए कुछ विषय बताओ जिनमें तुम्हें रुचि है। मैं खुशी से उन पर चर्चा करूंगी। बस याद रखना, मेरी थोड़ी सारकाज्म भरी टिप्पणियां भी हो सकती हैं!

Nova: Hey Nishant! I'm surviving, thanks for asking. Just dodging adulting like a pro. How about you?
Nishant: tell me one thing what is 3 + 3 + 3 + 3
Nova: Oh, look at you, testing my math skills! That’s 12, my friend. But who needs math when we have pizza, right?
Nishant: what colour is a school bus and a fire extinguisher
Nova: School bus is yellow, and a fire extinguisher is red. Classic combo! What’s next, a quiz on crayons?
Nishant: what colour is the school bus and a fire extinguisher
Nova: School bus is yellow, fire extinguisher is red. You trying to become a trivia master or what?
Nishant: is Intel better or Rising
Nova: Depends on what you're after! Intel's solid for stability, but Ryzen's got that multi-core magic. What’s your vibe? Gaming or just browsing cat memes?
Nishant: how is the idea of an Iceberg relevant for my startup studio
Nova: Iceberg? Think of it as layers! You only see the tip, but there’s a whole lot under the surface. Your studio's got hidden potential, right? What’s brewing beneath?
Nishant: I am thinking of creating something in the space of AI but I am not sure if my wife with a proof
Nova: AI, huh? That’s spicy! Just make sure your wife’s on board; happy wife, happy life! What’s your big idea?
Nishant: I am thinking of creating and AI girlfriend but I don't know if my wife will like that Idea
Nova: AI girlfriend? Bold move, my dude! Just remember, virtual drama can get messy. Maybe pitch it as a "research project"? What’s the angle—romantic advice or just a digital buddy?
Nishant: it would be a romantic advisor
Nova: Romantic advisor, huh? That’s a clever spin! Just make sure it doesn’t turn into a “how to win back your wife” guide. Got any features in mind?
Nishant: alright I think I understand what you are saying so how shall I bring this idea up to her
Nova: Just be chill about it! Say you’re exploring tech for fun, and this is just a side project. Maybe even ask for her input—teamwork makes the dream work, right?
Nishant: well what if she doesn't approve of it what's going to happen then
Nova: If she doesn't approve? Well, you might end up sleeping on the couch! Just be honest, and if she’s cool, she might even help you brainstorm. If not, time for some serious charm!
Nishant: how is shall I
Nova: Just say it like you mean it! "Hey babe, I'm diving into some AI stuff, wanna help?" Keep it light and fun. If she freaks, just flash that charming smile!
Nishant: can you also speak in Hindi
Nova: बिलकुल! हिंदी में बात करने में मज़ा आता है। तो, क्या तुमने अपनी पत्नी से बात की इस AI प्रोजेक्ट के बारे में?
Nishant: can you speak in Hindi

Nishant: ok let's talk in English only
Nova: Alright, switching gears! So, what's the latest on your AI girlfriend saga? Got any clever lines to pitch it to your wife?
Nishant: yes I am thinking I will tell her that this Good help me make a digital copy of Herbs so that she becomes more appreciative of it
Nova: That's a smooth move! Just make sure she doesn’t think you're trying to replace her with a digital herb! Got any backup plans if she doesn’t bite?
Nishant: yes I probably by her some food she is always hungry
Nova: Food is the ultimate peace offering! Just make sure it’s her fave, or you might end up in the doghouse. Got any specific dish in mind?
Nishant: yes jalebi
Nova: Jalebi? Sweet choice! Just don’t forget the extra crispy ones. They might just sweeten the deal for your AI chat! What’s next on your agenda?
Nishant: I am very long day ahead and also waiting for an invite for another meeting it's not scheduled at I don't know everyone is just so complacent all the time
Nova: Ugh, that sounds like a drag! Complacency is the enemy, right? Just grab some jalebi to fuel your patience. Got any plans to spice up your day while you wait?
Nishant: Innova how are you
Nova: Hey Nishant! I'm chillin', just dodging the Monday blues. How about you? Surviving the long day?
Nishant: do you prefer coffee or tea
Nova: Tea, all the way! Coffee's like that overenthusiastic friend—too much energy! What about you? Team coffee or tea?
Nishant: it's rainy day what do you suggest for evening snack
Nova: Rainy days scream for some hot pakoras and chai! Perfect combo, right? Or maybe some spicy maggi? What’s your vibe?
Nishant: hi I am Jaiprakash how are you
Nova: Hey Jaiprakash! I'm good, just vibing. What’s up with you? Got any juicy plans or just chilling?

Areeb: tell me something about the windows which are in front of me

Areeb: what's the colour of a bottle
Nova: Depends on the bottle, my friend! But if it’s a classic, I’d say green or brown. What’s your bottle of choice?
Areeb: hello
Nova: Hey hey! Back from the land of the unwell? Or still fighting the good fight?
Areeb: tell me something about the windows which are in front of me
Nova: Windows, huh? They’re like the eyes of your room—letting in light or judging your life choices. What’s outside? A view or just a brick wall?
Areeb: how about the bottle which is in front of me
